We have observed that the app sends data to the server even when the GPS is OFF. The expected behaviour is different, in fact the app should be closed and data shouldn't be send to the server. The location (both longitude and latitude) is set equal to zero.\\
When the GPS is turned on the location starts to be send in a correct way and it is set to the correct value. \\
We have also observed that once an anonymous request with subscription is created new pending requests starts to appear in the main page.
