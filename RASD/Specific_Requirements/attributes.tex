\subsection{Reliability}
The application must be available 24/7. Negligibly small concessions might be tolerated.

\subsection{Availability}
In order to guarantee high degree of availability, the system should have more than one server because in this way, in case a server fails, the other one will be ready to take over. The system is expected to be available 99.99 percent of the time for the users which have subscibed to \textit{ASOS}.

\subsection{Security}
Users and third parties credential should be confidentially stored and encrypted with high-security encryption. It must be guarantee to users that their data will be anonymized if they will be shared with a third party which has required a group of users data.

\subsection{Maintainability}
The app is going to be flexible and easy to maintain, it must be capable to facilitate addition of new features and options. For that purpose we will use clear code following the design patterns as much as possible. \\
Complete and detailed documentation will be provided in order to keep maintainability on the highest level.

\subsection{Portability}
The app will be written in Java EE so it could be exectued on any platform which support the Java Virtual Machine and runs JEE. The mobile app will have to work on both Android and IOS systems, the web one on the latest version of the main browsers as Google Chrome and Firefox.
