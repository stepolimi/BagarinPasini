The aim of this RASD is to provide a well detailed description of the \textit{TrackMe}'s system.
This is done by providing a precise presentation of the proposed solution and its purposes by giving all goals that we are intent to reach with it and all domain assumptions and requirements necessary to achive them.
This document has been redacted to be used by users and third parties with the objective to make the \textit{TrackMe}'s system clear.\vspace{0.5cm}\\The system is designed as two separated software applications: one, called \textit{Data4Help and AutomatedSOS}, is used for track and collect the user's health parameters and location and to call the SOS system in case of health parameters lower than the threshold values; the other, called \textit{Data4Help} used by third parties for require, receive and analize data of single users or groups of users.\\
The users' appilcation \textit{D4H and ASOS} is design to be an health tracker; it has the aim to collect and monitor his/her health parameters during the day and, in case of values lower than the threshold ones, to contact an SOS service and to give it the user's location. On the other hand the third parties's app \textit{D4H} is design to make requests of single users' data or group of users' data, to receive them in case of request's acceptance or a notification in the opposite case.
