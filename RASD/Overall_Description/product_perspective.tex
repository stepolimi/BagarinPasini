The main goals of the \hbox{\emph{Track Me}}'s system are to provide to the third parties a big pool of users from wich can gather data (offered by the base service of D4H) and to provide to the users a timely medical  assistance in case of illness (offered by the SOS service on top of D4H). The system is designed to be used as two different application: one for users and one for third parties. The users' application sends data about them to \hbox{\emph{Track Me}}'s servers where then they can be collected by third parties throught theirs application by making a request for receiving data of a specific users or anonimized data of multiple users. \hbox{\emph{Track Me}} uses user's data also for garanting a timely medical assistance to the users who have activated the ASOS service in case of drop of theirs healt parameters gathered by theirs application by contacting an external SOS service.\\
