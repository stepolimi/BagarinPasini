\section{Alloy worlds}
In this section there are three different examples of worlds descibed by the model:
\begin{itemize}
	\item figure 4.2 highlights the metamodel related to the code written above;
	\item figure 4.3 provides a sample of a third party with an accepted GroupUsersRequest and a refused one. To obtain an 			accepted GroupUsersRequest the bound of 1000 has been reduced to 2; 
	\item figure 4.4 has the aim to show how the model behaves with a SingleUserRequest.
	
\end{itemize}
