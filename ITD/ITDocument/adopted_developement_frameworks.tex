Java has been used for programming both the server and the client, in particular we have used Android Studio for developing the client and Ultimate IntelliJ for the server.

As already said in the DD JPA and JAX RS APIs has been used; to better know the reason why they have been chosen please read section two of the DD. In this document it is important to highlight that JPA and JAX RS provided by the chosen server Apache TomEE have been used; this means that we worked with OpenJPA and Apache CXF.\\ 
Jackson API has been used to transform in a simple way Json objects send from the Client via HTTP in Java classes. To use it, it is necessary to map every json value to one of the attributes of the related Java class.\\
Volley API has been used in the client to create in simple way HTTP request containing Json Objects and to easily receive the server response by overriding the ParseNetworkResponse method.
