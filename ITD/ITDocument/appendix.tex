The major part of the document has been produced working togheder and that's the reason way there is not a precise division of hours per sections and per group component.\\
The following is an approximate extimation of the number of hours of work for each group member:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alessandra Pasini: \textasciitilde 1 month of work * 5/7 ( hours day);
\item Stefano Bagarin: \textasciitilde 1 month of work * 5/7( hours day);
\end{itemize}
